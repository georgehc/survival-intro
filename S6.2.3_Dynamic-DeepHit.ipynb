    "# Section 6.2.3: Dynamic-DeepHit Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "Author: George H. Chen (georgechen [at symbol] cmu.edu)\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo coves how to implement Dynamic-DeepHit with competing risks (Lee et al., 2019) using PyTorch (based on code by Vincent Jeanselme: https://github.com/Jeanselme/DynamicDeepHit). For an overview of how Dynamic-DeepHit works, please see Section 6.2.3 of the monograph. This demo builds off the DeepHit (competing events) demo (`S6.1.4_DeepHit_competing.ipynb`), so please look at that first. We again use the PBC dataset (Fleming and Harrington, 1991), for which the first event is \"death\" and the second is \"transplanted\". We now treat the PBC dataset as a variable-length time series dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: In this demo, to avoid confusion in terminology, we use \"time\" to refer to different points in time of a time series, whereas we use \"duration\" to refer to the time-to-event outcome of interest, measured starting from the last time step per time series (refer to Sections 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 in the monograph for details). Note that for simplicity, we do *not* implement any of the strategies mentioned in \"Practical considerations\" at the end of Section 6.2.3 of the monograph.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Disclaimer*: Note that Jeanselme's code uses various conventions specific to the `auton-survival` package. Our demo here intentionally tries to stick to what would be considered standard PyTorch conventions (so that as a warning up front, what we present here does not perfectly align with `auton-survival` demos but will more closely resemble how PyTorch is commonly used in many other settings, including for instance how model training works in TorchSurv). In particular, our demo here will expose some of the under the hood code logic as to make some preprocessing and model training steps more transparent (so that making modifications to any part of these should be more straightforward)."

    "Importantly, the code is written so that it only makes a prediction at the very last time step per test time series. If you wanted to have a prediction as you saw more and more of a time series, you would have to write additional code (this would be straightforward in that you just give the model a truncated version of a test time series such as only the first time step of it, and then only the first two time steps of it, etc).\n",

    "Note that given this setup where we only predict at the last time step per test time series, if we believe that having time 0 correspond to the last time step makes sense for this setup, then we could compute evaluation metrics the same way as we did for the DeepHit competing risks demo. We illustrate this below. Note that for simplicity, we rearrange `cifs` into the same format as what gets outputted by PyCox's DeepHit model; namely, we create a Python variable `cif_test_np` that is a Numpy array with shape (number of critical events, number of time steps in `duration_grid_train_np`, number of test points)."
